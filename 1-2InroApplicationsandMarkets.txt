Welcome to Greenhouse Management, I'm Holly Scoggins. This lecture is an overview the various applications of greenhouses, plus markets or products grown in commercial greenhouses. The commercial greenhouse, in the context of this course, is used to grow plants and plant products for sale, ideally at a profit. This is by far the most common use of greenhouses.  The crops can be very diverse, as noted in the previous lecture, from marigolds to microgreens, or a combination thereof. The crops are then sold at wholesale, which is business to business, or at retail, directly to the consumer. Wholesale operations tend to be larger, but many small and medium size operations can be a combination of the two.  To vastly oversimplify the upside of each of these markets, retail growers charge a higher price, and thus have greater profit margins. Wholesale growers sell at a lower price, but often larger volume, and don't don't have to deal with the general public. We'll come back to these markets in a little bit.  First, let's look at some other greenhouse applications. Institutional implies the greenhouse is used in some way to further the mission of the institution, not necessarily for profit, but for education and research. However, schools, botanic gardens, and even prisons grow plants for educational experiences, for their landscapes and displays.  And then they indeed grow them and sell them to the public as fundraisers. I know a number of students in this course that have had wonderful hands on experience at either the middle school, high school, community college, or university level in growing and selling plants. Corporate research and development, or institutional research, in plant breeding, production of plant products and byproducts, and the study of pests and pathogens in related industries, such as agricultural chemical companies, all require greenhouses.  In most cases, high levels of control are needed to limit fluctuations of temperature, light, and humidity. A normal greenhouse can have a 10 to 15 degree temperature range. A very high tech research house can limit that range to just a couple of degrees. There are also biosecurity regulations at both the institutional and federal level.  An example of a protocol could be level two would cover GMOs that aren't approved for release yet. So any material coming out of a level two area would have to be autoclaved, to kill any seeds or pathogens. Level three precautions are much stricter and apply to things like pests and pathogens that haven't been previously found in a specific area, region or country.  This biosecurity level may involve a shower in and a shower out procedure, and nothing can be taken from the facility. There are many, many more requirements and protocols for these various levels. If you're interested, see the publication linked as a resource in this module. Conservatories first came about in Europe, they're called orangeries.  They were places to store tropical and tender plants, such as citrus, over the winter. The golden age of conservatories was the 1800s, with gorgeous glass houses springing up all over England and northern Europe. They're now a popular part of many public gardens, enabling exhibits and events that draw visitors in every season.  Conservatories can provide a variety of custom climates, ranging from a tropical rainforest to an arid desert environment. This is also useful for gardens and other institutions involved in rare or endangered plant conservation and protection. Back to the commercial greenhouse. We've previously discussed the wide variety of crops that can be grown in a greenhouse.  Now we'll take a look at the markets for these products. First let's talk about the wholesale market, that's business to business. Propagation specialists are simply growing for other growers. Plant propagation is very labor intensive and requires specialized growing areas. You're growing a lot of plants in a relatively small space, often for only a few weeks, and then those are sold and shipped.  More are started in their place, this is called turning the bench or simply a turn. Propagation specialists are simply growing for other growers.

You're growing a lot of plants in a relatively small space, often for only a few weeks, and then those are sold and shipped.  More are then started in their place. This is called turning the bench, or simply a turn, in the lingo. One of the very few standards that exist in the industry is tray size. And that's just the overall dimensions, not the size, shape or quantity of cells within the tray, which seem to be infinite.  Being in the baby plant business is exceedingly hands-on even if the operation has state of the art technology. There is so little growing media around the roots that they can dry out in an hour or two on a sunny day. Or they can stay wet and soggy, inviting all kinds of pathogens if it's a cool and cloudy day.  Successful propagators understand there's both a science and an art to young plant management. Consider it a career option if you're particularly good at it. Demand can fluctuate based on sales of the finished product. And there are lots of costs involved in shipping. Lots of propagators do ship overnight via FedEx or similar, and it can get expensive.  Most wholesale floriculture operations are relatively large, as profit margins are reduced compared to retail, so volume becomes critical to make a profit. Regarding starter plants, there is a continuum of those who start all their own plants to those who purchase just about all of their plugs and liners from propagators.  Most wholesale greenhouses sell to garden centers. This is a very broad category. It may be part of some other business, such as a big box home improvement store or a seasonal sales area at Southern States or some other ag supply store. Or it could be a standalone year round garden center.  These are often known as independent garden centers, or IGCs. You've also seen seasonal bedding plant displays outside of grocery stores. Many also have a dedicated floral area. Florists don't sell just cut flowers, they also sell potted plants for home decor and gifts. Last but not least is the commercial landscape trade.  Landscape businesses purchase seasonal bedding plants and perennials in relatively large quantities. So even retail growers usually offer them a significant discount. Growers usually love their landscapers. Products are usually pre-booked, so it's a known quantity that will be picked up at a specific time. Talk wholesale produce. Greenhouse grown produce can be sold daily, seasonally, or by contract to other businesses for resale or use.  Cooperatives and distributors garner products from multiple sources to offer to their customers. The farm to table movement, smart chefs are clamoring for local sustainably produced vegetables and fruit. However, there can be a lack of consistency in demand and the challenge is in coordinating harvest times to the needs of the restaurant.  About the retail market for greenhouse grown produce. As with field grown vegetables, products can be sold directly to the public through many venues. But as we discussed previously, having a greenhouse can greatly extend the season for all these market scenarios. A farmstand is a retail outlet, usually directly on the farm property.  It can feature both fresh produce and value added products made on the farm, such as jam, sauces, and more. Farmers markets are a great low-overhead way to get your produce to the people. This interest in farmers markets has just exploded over the last few years. Know that some markets cannot accommodate all the growers that wanna sell there and often they have a vendor waiting list.  Community supported agriculture, or CSAs, are basically a form of contract growing. Produce is pre-sold through subscription programs and is picked up by the customer on a weekly basis. And though there are niche you pick markets, growers generally wanna control all of the harvesting themselves. There are a food safety issues in letting the general public into the greenhouse, so this doesn't happen very often.  For more on food safety regulations for greenhouse growers, see the additional resources within this module. For floriculture crops, such as bedding plants, perennials, and flowering potted plants, your home town retail greenhouse sells what they grow on site. Sometimes they'll supplement their product mix with additional landscape plants, such as trees and shrubs.  Some retailers keep production and sale separate. But small growers often let customers into most of their greenhouses. Once you start additional non-plant items, these are called hard goods, such as gardening gear, or containers, fertilizer, shovels, seasonal decor, things like that, the retail greenhouse moves into the realm of garden center.  There's some extraordinary garden centers out there, often called destination garden centers. For example, Merrifield Garden Center's flagship store in Gainesville has not only the full array of plant and gardening needs, but furniture and lighting, a wine and gourmet food shop, an on site cafe and a dog park.  All this value added stuff can help sustain sales throughout the seasons. Because the majority, at least 75% or more, of yearly sales of plants occurs during a span about three months during the spring gardening frenzy. Some greenhouse manufacturers specialize in designing and building retail greenhouses. It needs to be attractive, safe, and easy to get around in, from both the product movement and customers' point of view.  Wide aisles are a must, you want it to be as easy as possible for your customers to fill up their carts. Ventilation and air movement are essential to keeping temperatures comfortable. In an upcoming lecture, we're gonna talk about how challenging temperature management can be in a greenhouse. Back to the garden center greenhouse, it also has to be a secure environment.  It's a retail establishment with virtually transparent walls. So in summary, beyond the standard commercial greenhouse, there are specialized applications for greenhouses, such as research and development, education, conservation and display. Commercial greenhouse markets include wholesale, retail or a combination of the two. And there's some important differences in these markets between floriculture and vegetable production.
